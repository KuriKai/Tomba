Want to help rip sprites from this game? Then you have come to the right place.

Ripping the sprites for this game is pretty easy but needs a bit of practice

# You will need:

- [GGD](http://randomhoohaas.flyingomelette.com/ai/spriterip/#ggd) - With this program you can view the sprites of the game.

- LDAR (LoaD ARea) - This folder contains subfolders with all of the sprite data including the Pallets, you will use those with GGD. (Add a downlond link to all of the ldars)

## Optional

- [This](https://youtu.be/2q5lj30-7mU) Youtube video explaining how GGD works and how to get the correct output.

- [Sprite Sheeter](https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-29374.html) - Sprite Sheeter is a program to quickly generate spritesheets from a series of frame images, preview animations, and perform common sheeting tasks, rather than having to manually arrange images on a sheet with an image editor such as GIMP, Paint, or Photoshop.

 ### FAQ
 
 - My background sprites don't look good in GGD, what did i do wrong?
   - That is because you need to change a few settings for background sprites: *ImageSize* needs to be at 2048X512 and *Pixel/Bit* needs to be at 8Bit. (Press B)
