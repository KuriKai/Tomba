raw unused sprites etc, much more to be found for sure.
[Lot's of unused stuff has been ripped.](https://www.spriters-resource.com/playstation/tombi/)

# To-do
- [ ] Look trough all vrams once more and add all unused stuff in the correct AREA map.
- [ ] Try and rip the unused stuff correctly, then put them in a [spritesheet](https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-29374.html) and replace the raw image with it. (If it is supposed to be an animation, try and restore that also and post it including the sheet.
- [ ] Add a README file and explain what the sprite/animation in question was suppose to do.
- [ ] Make different folders like *Items *NPC Animations *envoriment
